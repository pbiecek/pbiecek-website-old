Data Scientist with background in both mathematical statistics [PAM@WUST](http://wmat.pwr.edu.pl/en/) and software engineering [CSM@WUST](http://wiz.pwr.edu.pl/en/).

I am interested in predictive modeling of large and complex data, data visualisation and model interepretability.
Research activities are mainly focused on high-throughput genetic profiling in oncology. 
Also interested in evidence based education, evidence based medicine, general machine learning modeling and statistical software engineering (an R enthusiast).
Big believer of data-literacy education for kids.

I am a data-driven person. My PhD advisor was [Prof. Witold Klonecki](http://www.ibspan.waw.pl/komisja.statystyki/wspomnienia/Klonecki.pdf). His PhD advisor was [Julian Perkal](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Perkal). And his PhD advisor was [Hugo Steinhaus](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Steinhaus).

My CV is available [here](http://biecek.pl/CV).

I like travels, board games and hiking.
