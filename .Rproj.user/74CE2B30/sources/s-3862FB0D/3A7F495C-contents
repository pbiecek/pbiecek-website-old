## Warsaw University of Technology

I work as associate professor in Machine Learning at Warsaw University of Technology. I am looking for new interesting applications of Machine Learning in medicine. Also I am working on new methods and tools that improve the process of model understanding, research reproducibility and human-model interaction. 

I lead MI^2 group of data enthusiasts, mostly MSc and PhD students. Together we create tools, try new methods and look for interesting opportunities to squeeze useful information from vast amount of data.
