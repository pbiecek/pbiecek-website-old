## Beta Bit

In 2012 I've started Beta and Bit initiative with a simple purpose in mind. Let's create resources that will be interesting for other data-driven people.

The goal is to have fun while playing with data. Today we have some stories, comic books and games. And working on new stuff.

The official website of the project is here: http://betabit.wiki/

Beta loves math, books and puzzles. Bit loves to hack robots, crack passwords and run into troubles. Together they are a team of curious and unstoppable data crunchers getting to know the world around them through the prism of fun with the data.
