title: Solutions42 - the Powerhouse for Responsible Artificial Intelligence

Over the last 15 years I have carried out research and development for a number of public (University of Warsaw, Warsaw University of Technology) and private organisations (Samsung, Netezza, IBM, PositiveSolutions, Disney, iQor, LekSeek). 
In 2021 I founded Solutions42 to share this experience with other companies.

[Solutions42.ai](http://Solutions42.ai) is an agile company helping large and small partners to design, implement and deploy Responsible Artificial Intelligence solutions.

We take an individual approach to each customer. We provide trainings, develop software, validate existing models or create new ones.

If you would like to discuss a possible collaboration, feel free to [contact me](https://pbiecek.github.io/contact.html).
